# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my implementation of various **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** in Java.  
I am actively solving problems to strengthen my understanding and improve problem-solving skills.

## Contents
- Core data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, HashMaps, etc.
- Classic algorithms such as Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Backtracking, and Dynamic Programming.
- Problem-solving approaches including brute-force, optimized, and edge-case handling.

> ðŸš€ Iâ€™m using this space to deepen my DSA knowledge and get ready for challenging interviews at product-based companies.
